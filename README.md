# Data Visualisation Dashboard

This repository contains my experiments with visualising a given dataset, so as to convey maximum information to the viewer.

Experimenting with Flask (a light weight python microframework for hosting server) and D3.js (https://d3js.org/) library for rendering interesting visualisations.
The server is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance at http://codebull.xyz/donorschoose
